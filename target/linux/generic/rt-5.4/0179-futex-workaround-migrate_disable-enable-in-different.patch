Subject: [PATCH 179/298] futex: workaround migrate_disable/enable in different
 context

migrate_enable() invokes __schedule() and it expects a preempt count of one.
Holding a raw_spinlock_t with disabled interrupts should not allow scheduling.

These little hacks ensure that we don't schedule while we lock the hb lockwith
interrupts enabled and unlock it with interrupts disabled.

[XXX: As per PeterZ suggesstion
	set_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED); preempt_fold_need_resched()
 would trigger a scheduler invocation on the last preempt_enable() which in
 turn would allow to drop this.
