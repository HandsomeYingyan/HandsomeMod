Subject: [PATCH 118/305] mm/page_alloc: Use migrate_disable() in
 drain_local_pages_wq()

The drain_local_pages_wq() uses preempt_disable() to ensure that there
will be no CPU migration while drain_local_pages() is invoked which
might happen if the CPU is going down.
drain_local_pages() acquires a sleeping lock on RT which can not be
acquired with disabled preemption.

Use migrate_disable() instead of preempt_disable(): On RT it ensures
that the CPU won't go down and on !RT it is replaced with
preempt_disable().
