Subject: [PATCH 073/298] workqueue: Don't assume that the callback has
 interrupts disabled

Due to the TIMER_IRQSAFE flag, the timer callback is invoked with
disabled interrupts. On -RT the callback is invoked in softirq context
with enabled interrupts. Since the interrupts are threaded, there are
are no in_irq() users. The local_bh_disable() around the threaded
handler ensures that there is either a timer or a threaded handler
active on the CPU.

Disable interrupts before __queue_work() is invoked from the timer
callback.
